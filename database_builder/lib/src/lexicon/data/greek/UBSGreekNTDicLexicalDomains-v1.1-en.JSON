In biblical times the regions above the earth were often regarded as consisting of various strata, and these views seem to be reflected in a number of NT contexts. Paul, for example, speaks of τρίτος οὐρανός ‘the third heaven’ as being the παράδεισος τοῦ θεοῦ, that is ‘God’s paradise’ (ἁρπαγέντα τὸν τοιοῦτον ἕως τρίτου οὐρανοῦ … ἡρπάγη εἰς τὸν παράδεισον ‘this man was snatched up into the third heaven … he was caught up into paradise’ 2 Cor 12:2–4). Another significant stratum in the heavens seems to be the area in which the stars, sun, and moon existed. A third region may be regarded as ‘the air,’ that is to say, the region where birds fly. It is, however, impossible to insist upon a rigid boundary between such areas, for such ancient beliefs were not based upon fixed classifications or distinctions.

Artifacts may be classified on the basis of three different sets of features: (1) materials of which the object is made, (2) the form of the object, and (3) the function or use of the object. The third basis of classification has been generally employed in setting up the following subdomains of Artifacts, since use and function are so important for the translator and more often than not constitute the basis for determining adequate equivalents between languages. Function is not, however, a fully satisfactory basis for classification, since the same object may have more than one function. For example, ‘stocks’ may be instruments either (1) for fastening or binding and/or (2) for punishment. The meanings of the terms τρῆμα, τρύπημα, and τρυμαλιά ‘hole’ ({D:6.216}) should theoretically be treated in a larger domain of openings and apertures, but in the NT these terms are only used to refer to a hole in a needle, and hence for the convenience of translators these terms are treated together with the term for needle, since they refer specifically to a particular kind of a hole. The corresponding expressions in various receptor languages are often highly specific and frequently involve idiomatic equivalences. Because of the many different types of artifacts in this domain and the rather conspicuous gaps which occur because of the limited corpus of documents in the NT, it is not possible to arrange the subdomains in a strictly logical sequence or in an outline with several layers of logical distinctions. There are, however, a number of clusters of subdomains which may be significant for translators, for example, Subdomains {X:006002} and {X:006003}. There is also a significant relationship between Subdomain {X:006004} and Subdomain {X:006005}.

A further important distinction may be made with respect to terms referring to animals eating in contrast with humans eating."}],"Level":2,"Prototype":"","Reference":"","Code":"023001","HasSubDomains":false,"Entries":[]},{"SemanticDomainLocalizations":[{"LanguageCode":"en","Label":"Processes Involving the Mouth, Other Than Eating and Drinking","Description":"","Opposite":"","Comment":""}],"Level":2,"Prototype":"","Reference":"","Code":"023002","HasSubDomains":false,"Entries":[]},{"SemanticDomainLocalizations":[{"LanguageCode":"en","Label":"Birth, Procreation","Description":"","Opposite":"","Comment":""}],"Level":2,"Prototype":"","Reference":"","Code":"023003","HasSubDomains":false,"Entries":[]},{"SemanticDomainLocalizations":[{"LanguageCode":"en","Label":"Sexual Relations","Description":"","Opposite":"","Comment":"It would be possible to classify the various meanings of this subdomain as involving primarily interpersonal relations (Domain {X:034}) rather than physiological processes and states, since in at least certain contexts the emphasis seems to be upon the manner in which people relate to one another rather than upon the physiological state or activity involved in such relations."}],"Level":2,"Prototype":"","Reference":"","Code":"023004","HasSubDomains":false,"Entries":[]},{"SemanticDomainLocalizations":[{"LanguageCode":"en","Label":"Sleep, Waking","Description":"","Opposite":"","Comment":""}],"Level":2,"Prototype":"","Reference":"","Code":"023005","HasSubDomains":false,"Entries":[]},{"SemanticDomainLocalizations":[{"LanguageCode":"en","Label":"Tire, Rest","Description":"","Opposite":"","Comment":""}],"Level":2,"Prototype":"","Reference":"","Code":"023006","HasSubDomains":false,"Entries":[]},{"SemanticDomainLocalizations":[{"LanguageCode":"en","Label":"Live, Die","Description":"","Opposite":"","Comment":""}],"Level":2,"Prototype":"","Reference":"","Code":"023007","HasSubDomains":false,"Entries":[]},{"SemanticDomainLocalizations":[{"LanguageCode":"en","Label":"Health, Vigor, Strength","Description":"","Opposite":"","Comment":""}],"Level":2,"Prototype":"","Reference":"","Code":"023008","HasSubDomains":false,"Entries":[]},{"SemanticDomainLocalizations":[{"LanguageCode":"en","Label":"Sickness, Disease, Weakness","Description":"","Opposite":"","Comment":""}],"Level":2,"Prototype":"","Reference":"","Code":"023009","HasSubDomains":false,"Entries":[]},{"SemanticDomainLocalizations":[{"LanguageCode":"en","Label":"Breathe, Breath","Description":"","Opposite":"","Comment":""}],"Level":2,"Prototype":"","Reference":"","Code":"023010","HasSubDomains":false,"Entries":[]},{"SemanticDomainLocalizations":[{"LanguageCode":"en","Label":"Grow, Growth","Description":"","Opposite":"","Comment":""}],"Level":2,"Prototype":"","Reference":"","Code":"023011","HasSubDomains":false,"Entries":[]},{"SemanticDomainLocalizations":[{"LanguageCode":"en","Label":"Ripen, Produce Fruit, Bear Seed","Description":"","Opposite":"","Comment":""}],"Level":2,"Prototype":"","Reference":"","Code":"023012","HasSubDomains":false,"Entries":[]},{"SemanticDomainLocalizations":[{"LanguageCode":"en","Label":"Rot, Decay","Description":"","Opposite":"","Comment":""}],"Level":2,"Prototype":"","Reference":"","Code":"023013","HasSubDomains":false,"Entries":[]},{"SemanticDomainLocalizations":[{"LanguageCode":"en","Label":"Sensory Events and States","Description":"","Opposite":"","Comment":"Domain {X:024} includes meanings in which any one of the five senses or certain combinations of these are involved.

For some of the emotions in Domain {X:025} there are significant physiological aspects. Within Domain {X:025} one will immediately note a number of clusters of related subdomains. For example, Subdomains {X:025001}, {X:025002}, {X:025004}, {X:025005}, and {X:025006} involve future orientation, and some of these share significant elements of ‘desire.’ Subdomains {X:025008}, {X:025009}, {X:025010}, and {X:025011} involve ‘pleasure’ and ‘happiness,’ and Subdomain {X:025003} in certain ways links these two groups of subdomains. Subdomains {X:020}, {X:021}, and {X:022} involve varying degrees of ‘astonishment,’ ‘anxiety,’ and ‘fear.’ Certain meanings may be regarded as generic features of attitudes and emotions, but these are treated primarily in Domain {X:026} and in Domain {X:090}, which includes meanings dealing with experiencing events and states. Of all the semantic domains, {X:025} is most likely to consist of numerous idiomatic and figurative expressions. The reason for this is that attitudes and emotions are essentially subjective events and states, and there is a marked tendency in languages to describe such subjective experiences in terms of figurative expressions or idioms, which for the most part employ terms for body parts in the viscera. This is, of course, the result of reactions of the so-called sympathetic nervous system. Those organs which are most frequently employed in expressions of attitudes and emotions are the liver, the diaphragm, the heart, and the stomach. In a number of languages in Africa, one encounters such expressions as ‘to have a liver,’ meaning to be brave,’ and ‘to have a diaphragm,’ meaning ‘to have a guilty conscience.’ ‘To have a heart,’ may, however, mean ‘to be patient,’ and ‘to have a cool stomach’ often means ‘to be happy.’ In a number of languages there may be a whole series of expressions based on some one particular internal organ. For example, in the Conob language of Guatemala (a Mayan language) a ‘mixed-up stomach’ signifies ‘astonishment,’ while a ‘stomach that dies’ means ‘love,’ and a ‘stomach that rises’ signifies ‘hate.’ A ‘dried-up stomach’ denotes ‘sadness,’ and ‘to cry in the stomach’ means ‘to take pity on someone.’ In Africa there is a tendency to build a number of idioms on a term for ‘liver.’ In the Anuak language of the Sudan (a Nilotic language) there are the following expressions which employ in one way or another the term for ‘liver’: ‘my liver is sweet’ (‘I am happy’); ‘my liver is bitter’ (‘I am completely unsociable’); ‘a heavy liver’ (‘to be sad’); ‘a shallow liver’ (‘a tendency to get angry quickly’); ‘a bad liver’ (‘unhappy’); ‘a large liver’ (‘greedy’); ‘a light-colored liver’ (‘well-disposed, sociable’); ‘a cold liver’ (‘not emotionally upset’); ‘a hot liver’ (‘passionately upset’); ‘a black liver’ (‘unsociable’); ‘to light up the liver’ (‘to be lonely for’); ‘the liver falls’ (‘to be sorry’); ‘the liver floats’ (‘to be uncertain’); ‘the liver jumps up’ (‘to be angry quickly’). Some translators have hesitated to use terms meaning ‘liver’ or ‘stomach,’ since they regard such expressions as being psychologically and physiologically inappropriate, but they are no more inappropriate or anomalous than the English use of ‘heart,’ and in many instances it simply is not possible to speak of various attitudes and emotions without using these terms which refer to various internal organs."}],"Level":1,"Prototype":"","Reference":"","Code":"025","HasSubDomains":true,"Entries":[]},{"SemanticDomainLocalizations":[{"LanguageCode":"en","Label":"Desire, Want, Wish","Description":"","Opposite":"","Comment":""}],"Level":2,"Prototype":"","Reference":"","Code":"025001","HasSubDomains":false,"Entries":[]},{"SemanticDomainLocalizations":[{"LanguageCode":"en","Label":"Desire Strongly","Description":"","Opposite":"","Comment":"Subdomain {X:025002} includes meanings which are ethically neutral, ethically valued, and those which are ethically disvalued, in the sense of being that which is not moral.

In the Domain {X:32}, the first set of subdomains ({X:032001} to {X:032003}) deals essentially with the process of comprehension, while Subdomains {X:032004} and {X:032005} focus upon the capacity for understanding, and accordingly, meanings such as ‘foolish,’ ‘senseless,’ ‘wise,’ and ‘intelligent’ are included."}],"Level":1,"Prototype":"","Reference":"","Code":"032","HasSubDomains":true,"Entries":[]},{"SemanticDomainLocalizations":[{"LanguageCode":"en","Label":"Understand","Description":"","Opposite":"","Comment":"In a number of languages the equivalent of ‘understand’ consists of a more generic term for mental activity plus some kind of qualifier; hence, ‘to understand’ may be literally ‘to really know’ or ‘to think right about’ or ‘to perceive clearly’ or ‘to see with the mind.’"}],"Level":2,"Prototype":"","Reference":"","Code":"032001","HasSubDomains":false,"Entries":[]},{"SemanticDomainLocalizations":[{"LanguageCode":"en","Label":"Come To Understand","Description":"","Opposite":"","Comment":"The meanings in {X:032002} obviously imply capacity, but this particular element is not focal; rather, it is the process by which one arrives at understanding which seems to be semantically dominant in the meanings of this series."}],"Level":2,"Prototype":"","Reference":"","Code":"032002","HasSubDomains":false,"Entries":[]},{"SemanticDomainLocalizations":[{"LanguageCode":"en","Label":"Ease or Difficulty in Understanding","Description":"","Opposite":"","Comment":""}],"Level":2,"Prototype":"","Reference":"","Code":"032003","HasSubDomains":false,"Entries":[]},{"SemanticDomainLocalizations":[{"LanguageCode":"en","Label":"Capacity for Understanding","Description":"","Opposite":"","Comment":""}],"Level":2,"Prototype":"","Reference":"","Code":"032004","HasSubDomains":false,"Entries":[]},{"SemanticDomainLocalizations":[{"LanguageCode":"en","Label":"Lack of Capacity for Understanding","Description":"","Opposite":"","Comment":""}],"Level":2,"Prototype":"","Reference":"","Code":"032005","HasSubDomains":false,"Entries":[]},{"SemanticDomainLocalizations":[{"LanguageCode":"en","Label":"Communication","Description":"","Opposite":"","Comment":"As may be readily noted from the Outline of Subdomains, there are a number of ways in which the subdomains are related to one another. Unfortunately, this cannot be made clear by an outline. Noting distinctive features by means of a matrix or a comparison of formulae based on a calculus of meanings would reveal certain important relations, but all of the semantic features and interrelations of meaning could never be satisfactorily diagrammed in view of the multi-dimensional sets of relations. Thus, the order and arrangement of the subdomains is bound to seem somewhat artificial and arbitrary. It may, however, be useful to point out some of the related sets. For example, Subdomains {X:033001}–{X:033005} are largely metalinguistic. Subdomains {X:033012}, {X:033013}, and {X:033014} involve requests and presumed responses, while Subdomains {X:033015}, {X:033016}, and {X:033017} are primarily informative in nature. Subdomains {X:033018}–{X:033022} contain an important factor of implied truth and the relationship of the speaker to such truth. Subdomains {X:033024}–{X:033032} have an element of future orientation, while Subdomains {X:033042}–{X:033049} involve adverse content, and Subdomains {X:033050}–{X:033052} involve opposition. Finally, Subdomains {X:033053}-{X:033055} involve certain supernatural elements. These particular groupings of subdomains are, of course, not the only subclasses, but they are some of the more conspicuous ones. It would, however, be possible to organize the subdomains in quite different ways. For example, reciprocal involvement in communication could include Subdomains {X:033011}, {X:033023}, {X:033050}, {X:033051}, and {X:033052}. A factor of imposition of the speaker upon a presumed hearer could include {X:033028}, {X:033031}, {X:033032}, {X:033033}, {X:033045}, and {X:033046}. These multidimensional relations will, of course, be even more obvious as one studies the detailed distinctions given in the definitions of the various meanings under each subdomain."}],"Level":1,"Prototype":"","Reference":"","Code":"033","HasSubDomains":true,"Entries":[]},{"SemanticDomainLocalizations":[{"LanguageCode":"en","Label":"Language","Description":"","Opposite":"","Comment":""}],"Level":2,"Prototype":"","Reference":"","Code":"033001","HasSubDomains":false,"Entries":[]},{"SemanticDomainLocalizations":[{"LanguageCode":"en","Label":"Word, Passage","Description":"","Opposite":"","Comment":""}],"Level":2,"Prototype":"","Reference":"","Code":"033002","HasSubDomains":false,"Entries":[]},{"SemanticDomainLocalizations":[{"LanguageCode":"en","Label":"Discourse Types","Description":"","Opposite":"","Comment":""}],"Level":2,"Prototype":"","Reference":"","Code":"033003","HasSubDomains":false,"Entries":[]},{"SemanticDomainLocalizations":[{"LanguageCode":"en","Label":"Language Levels","Description":"","Opposite":"","Comment":""}],"Level":2,"Prototype":"","Reference":"","Code":"033004","HasSubDomains":false,"Entries":[]},{"SemanticDomainLocalizations":[{"LanguageCode":"en","Label":"Written Language","Description":"","Opposite":"","Comment":""}],"Level":2,"Prototype":"","Reference":"","Code":"033005","HasSubDomains":false,"Entries":[]},{"SemanticDomainLocalizations":[{"LanguageCode":"en","Label":"Speak, Talk","Description":"","Opposite":"","Comment":""}],"Level":2,"Prototype":"","Reference":"","Code":"033006","HasSubDomains":false,"Entries":[]},{"SemanticDomainLocalizations":[{"LanguageCode":"en","Label":"Sing, Lament","Description":"","Opposite":"","Comment":""}],"Level":2,"Prototype":"","Reference":"","Code":"033007","HasSubDomains":false,"Entries":[]},{"SemanticDomainLocalizations":[{"LanguageCode":"en","Label":"Keep Silent","Description":"","Opposite":"","Comment":""}],"Level":2,"Prototype":"","Reference":"","Code":"033008","HasSubDomains":false,"Entries":[]},{"SemanticDomainLocalizations":[{"LanguageCode":"en","Label":"Name","Description":"","Opposite":"","Comment":""}],"Level":2,"Prototype":"","Reference":"","Code":"033009","HasSubDomains":false,"Entries":[]},{"SemanticDomainLocalizations":[{"LanguageCode":"en","Label":"Interpret, Mean, Explain","Description":"","Opposite":"","Comment":"As will be readily noted, a number of meanings in Subdomain {X:033010} parallel closely or overlap with such domains as {X:028}, especially in the meaning of ‘to cause to know,’ and {X:032}, likewise in the meaning of ‘to cause to understand.’ In Subdomain {X:033010}, however, the focus is on communicating the significance of something."}],"Level":2,"Prototype":"","Reference":"","Code":"033010","HasSubDomains":false,"Entries":[]},{"SemanticDomainLocalizations":[{"LanguageCode":"en","Label":"Converse, Discuss","Description":"","Opposite":"","Comment":"As the title of Subdomain {X:033011} suggests, the meanings in this subdomain involve multiple participants in communication, both those who speak and those who are spoken to."}],"Level":2,"Prototype":"","Reference":"","Code":"033011","HasSubDomains":false,"Entries":[]},{"SemanticDomainLocalizations":[{"LanguageCode":"en","Label":"Ask For, Request","Description":"","Opposite":"","Comment":""}],"Level":2,"Prototype":"","Reference":"","Code":"033012","HasSubDomains":false,"Entries":[]},{"SemanticDomainLocalizations":[{"LanguageCode":"en","Label":"Pray","Description":"","Opposite":"","Comment":"In addition to the expressions listed in this subdomain, there are others which are often translated ‘to pray’ or ‘prayer,’ namely, ἐρωτάω[b] ({D:33.161}), αἰτέω ({D:33.163}), δέομαι ({D:33.170}), and δέησις ({D:33.171}), used exclusively of urgent requests to God and thus normally translated ‘prayer,’ though these terms do not mean ‘prayer’ in and of themselves.

For the most part, numbering systems are either based on human extremities (the fingers and toes) or upon what is called ‘the blanket count,’ a system involving folds. The system based on human extremities more often than not consists of fundamental units often, that is to say, units based upon the counting of the fingers. In some languages, however, a system of twenty has been employed, so that a unit of twenty may even have the name of ‘a person.’ Therefore, a designation such as ‘five persons’ equals one hundred. Within any numbering system there may be numerous irregularities and shifts, so that one may employ either addition or subtraction. As a result, the number eleven may be ‘ten plus one,’ while nineteen may be ‘twenty minus one.’ Languages which use the so-called ‘blanket system’ often count as one, two, and then three becomes ‘two plus one,’ while four is ‘two doubled.’ Five then becomes ‘doubled two plus one’; six becomes ‘doubled two plus two,’ etc. Languages which employ this blanket system, however, normally do not have a very extended system of numbering. Even some languages which use the fingers or toes may be quite limited in numbering, so that specific numbers may not go to more than ten or twenty, after which there may be a series of terms indicating various large, indefinite numbers of items. Such strictly limited systems for numbering are typical, of course, of so-called ‘primitive peoples,’ but once such people come in contact with more complex and developed societies, they rapidly extend their numbering systems and often simply take over a numbering system from a dominant language in the area. In a number of languages all numbers specify the class of objects being counted. For example, all animate beings may be in one class, all plants in another, all lumpy objects in still another class, all liquids with still a separate designation, and the same would be true of such classes of objects as dry masses, long/ slender, flat/round, and flat objects with corners, etc. Sometimes the forms of the numbers are the same for all classes, but there is a bound affix associated with the numerals in order to designate the class of objects being counted. In other instances there are completely different number systems for different kinds of objects. All of these matters must be carefully considered in any translation of the Scriptures, particularly in contexts in which new material or spiritual items are being counted or numbered."}],"Level":1,"Prototype":"","Reference":"","Code":"060","HasSubDomains":true,"Entries":[]},{"SemanticDomainLocalizations":[{"LanguageCode":"en","Label":"Number, Countless","Description":"","Opposite":"","Comment":""}],"Level":2,"Prototype":"","Reference":"","Code":"060001","HasSubDomains":false,"Entries":[]},{"SemanticDomainLocalizations":[{"LanguageCode":"en","Label":"One, Two, Three, Etc.

In dealing with various meanings involving Value, there is a danger in equating values which seem at least superficially to be similar in meaning. For example, one might be tempted to equate the meanings of ‘valuable’ and ‘expensive,’ but ‘expensive’ relates to high price and may in some contexts simply suggest that the object in question costs far more than it is worth. Another danger in dealing with meanings of Value is to assume that nominal and adjectival forms are essentially equivalent in meaning, but this is by no means always the case. For example, to state that ‘the table is valuable’ means that on a scale of worth the table in question is relatively high, that is to say, considerably greater than the average for other objects of the same class which could be placed on such a scale. On the other hand, the expression ‘the value of the table’ does not necessarily imply that the table in question is valuable.

In a negative context one may also speak of a person being ‘worthy of death, that is to say, the behavior is judged as corresponding to the penalty of death.
